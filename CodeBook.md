where

1. Subject denotes the person who carried out the experiment 

2. Activity represents one of 6 undertaken activities 

3. All measurements are normalized to values in the range [-1,1]

4. Abbreviations have the following meanings:

         a) Acc = accelerometer 3-axial raw signals    
         b) iGyro= gyroscope 3-axial raw signals   
         c) t = time domain signals captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz   
         d) Body = body part of the signal obtained from a low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz   
         e) Gravity = gravity part of the signal obtained from a low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz  
         f) Freq = frequency   
         g) Jerk = jerk signals   
         h) Mag = euclidean norm of the signal    
         i) X,Y,Z = axis   
         j) f = frequency domain signals (FFT)
